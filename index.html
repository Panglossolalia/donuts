<h1>Doughnuts/Donuts</h1>

<h2>Concept</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Arrive at doughnut place.</li>
  <li>Eat doughnut (or a half-doughnut -- it's in the title after all).</li>
  <li>Run to another doughnut place</li>
  <li>Go to step 1.</li>
</ol>

Assuming 225 calories per half-doughnut, this event should be approximately energy-neutral after considering the 600 meters of elevation gain.
  
<h2>Route</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Approximately half-marathon distance (~21.1k).</li>
  <li>Mostly road, with scenic bits.</li>

</ul>

  <h2>Update 2018-4-28: Donut investigation</h2>
  
  I did a <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/1536778555">tour</a> of the donut places I hadn't visited before for donuts.
  
  <h3>Stops</h3>
  
  <ol>
    <li>The Kilted Donut at Leith market. Strawberry and cream donut. 10/10, would donut again.</li>
    <li>The Bearded Baker. Raspberry jam donut. 7/10, solid execution.</li>
    <li>The Cuckoo's bakery. Nae donuts! Had a fauxnut, in the form of a cookie sandwich with buttercream. NA/10, good but not a donut.</li>
    <li>Lovecrumbs. Nae donuts! 1/10 (would put zero, but that looks like a donut, which they don't have, ever).</li>
    <li>Deadly donuts. Nae donuts! Closed, may be dead in addition to deadly.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h3>General observations</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>I ate roughly 1.5 donuts worth (saved the rest) and it was a lot. Including ConsiderIt, Twelve Triangles, and Baba Budan would be a proper challenge.</li>
    <li>A roughly donut-shaped route may be possible; my abridged route was cruller-shaped.</li>
    <li>Kilted Donut donuts are really good. Go eat one. Don't use google maps to find them though. It lies.</li>
  </ul>  
    
<h3>Stops</h3>

TODO: Find when they're all open. Confirm that all places do reliably sell doughnuts.
